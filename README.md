To use it open the file imputation_gui and scroll down to the bottom. There is the main function. Click on start. Then a window opens. Add the dataset breastcancer-miss (breastcancer is the full file, and breastcancer-miss has missing entries). Then choose a AI. MissForest takes like 10s so just wait abit it will start. Then do whatever you feel like. At the end you can save the file.
